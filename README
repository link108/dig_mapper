mapping tool for dig


TODO
-I made this before  I knew of DNS::Resolv, I might scrap this and create a wrapper around DNS::Resolv for ip/domain name research.




-handle qualifiers
-deal with more mechanisms
-write to file
-print all ips associated with a domain
-fix printing spf
    -add tabs
-come up with more features?
